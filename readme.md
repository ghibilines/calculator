The reverse reverse polish calculator is the ultimate expression of Dada as caused by incompetence.
The subject, in agony over his own shortcomings, embraces them and ascends to pure genius.
This oxyMORONIC process, which can be considered "creative" and "Dada" by the unhinged,
redeems the faults of the subject, creating transitory unobservable intellect;
and thus the subject ascends.

After every maniacal episode, there follows a comedown. 
The subject is now confronted with his own monstrosity; without the ecstasy of creation to shelter him from the reality of the object, he is left to grapple with the existential implications of his creation. Haunted by the uncomfortable truth, he turns his back to his own creation, and abandons it.
